# Architecture

I've already used many architectures in my professional life, and I noticed that all of them have pros and cons (others have more pros than cons).

A curious fact is that I love to search for the most advanced technologies being used in the big techs and apply them in my personal/professional codes. I read an article which the writer had the same perception I had, joining the cons of the most used architectures in the industry (Clean, Hexagonal, DDD, Onion, etc.). If you like to follow new good tendencies, [here](https://herbertograca.com/2017/11/16/explicit-architecture-01-ddd-hexagonal-onion-clean-cqrs-how-i-put-it-all-together/) is the awesome article was written by Heberto Gra√ßa.
